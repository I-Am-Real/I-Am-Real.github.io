#Starting from scratch
Hello. I plan, or at least try, to get into data analytics and found that Excel or spreadsheets in general are essential to it. I have some experiences though most of it is just scattered knowhows rather than
a comprehensive, structured knowledge on how to actually work on it. So I might as well start from scratch. After a bunch of searching, I found the youtube channel 'excelisfun'. He has a series from beginner to advance
which I(hopefully) plan to follow until at least Power BI(I don't know what this is but this seems important). Here, I'll be recording my insights and mental blocks.
